<div class="content"><br><p>The schoolyard can be a wild and unruly place, but even battle-hardened sissies need a sense of honor and fairness -- all those triumphs and humiliations don't mean nearly as much otherwise. That's why we created the SiSSYFiGHT Honor Code, with the help of many thoughtful players from the SiSSYFiGHT community. Listed below are the rules that all SiSSYFiGHTers are expected to play, fight, and live by while using this site.</p>

<p>In addition to the Honor Code, participation in SiSSYFiGHT requires you to agree to the <A HREF="#toc">Terms and Conditions</A> listed below the Honor Code. It's a lot of legal language, some of it overlapping with the Honor Code, which is meant to spell out the "spirit of the law" for SiSSYFiGHT in easily readable language. Please read both the Honor Code and the <A HREF="#toc">Terms and Conditions</A>, as well as the <A HREF="#privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</A> at the bottom of this page!</p>

<p align=center><strong>The SiSSYFiGHT Honor Code</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Multisessioning.</strong> You may not play SiSSYFiGHT in more than one window at the same time. This includes playing two different SiSSYFiGHTers at the same time, playing the same SiSSYFiGHTer in more than one school, or using custom software to automate gameplay.

<p><strong>2. Offensive comments and personal attacks.</strong> Catty insults and trash-talking are allowed in SiSSYFiGHT. You may not, however, engage in the following unacceptable behavior:<ul><li>hate speech of any kind, including language demeaning anyone's race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or size
<li>threats of real life violence
<li>harassment, including hacking or malicious activity targeting another player
<li>personal attacks concerning someone's real life identity
<li>comments that reveal private information about another player against their wishes
<li>any kind of libelous or slanderous comments about another player (the person, as opposed to their SiSSYFiGHT persona or their actions in-game)</ul>

<p><strong>3. Outside Communication.</strong> When you're playing a game of SiSSYFiGHT, you should only communicate with the other players using the in-game chat bubbles. Any other method of communication is cheating, including instant messaging, texting, telephone, smoke signals, and even talking with someone in the same room. If you cheat, you may be hunted down and ruthlessly humiliated by vigilante anti-cheater organizations. Talking in secret code or foreign languages within the game is not considered cheating, and neither is strategizing with a friend before a game starts.

<p><strong>4. Fair Play.</strong> Games that involve no real competition are not in the spirit of fair play and are not compatible with the Honor Code. 

<p><strong>5. Disruption of Play.</strong> You may not disrupt other players' discussion, chatting, or gameplay. For instance, flooding the homeroom chat window and making it impossible for others to talk is not allowed. 

<p><strong>6. Other Disruptive Behavior.</strong> You may not engage in behavior or activities designed to disrupt the SiSSYFiGHT community or the operation of the SiSSYFiGHT website or game servers, harass a player or administrator, or invade any person's privacy.

<p><strong>7. Impersonation.</strong> You may not impersonate a SiSSYFiGHT administrator. Also, you may not create temporary or registered SiSSYFiGHTers with the sole purpose of impersonating another player, or access another player's account in any way without their permission. You're also responsible for the confidentiality of your own password, and we recommend that you do not share it!

<p><strong>8. E-mail address.</strong> You must use a valid e-mail address so that we can contact you in case of a problem with your SiSSYFiGHTer. SiSSYFiGHT accounts without valid e-mail addresses may be modified without notification, because we won't have any way to get in touch with you.

<p><strong>9. Privacy.</strong> We will keep your e-mail address private. SiSSYFiGHT records the IP address of the computer you use to connect to the SiSSYFiGHT server, but we will keep your IP address private. However, we reserve the right to make our server records public, without revealing specific IP addresses. This means that people playing or posting under more than one different name can and will be identified in problem situations. See the <A HREF="#privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</A> below for more information.

<p><strong>10. Age restrictions.</strong> For legal reasons, if you are under the age of 13, you may not play SiSSYFiGHT. Sorry, kids.

<p><strong>11. Unsolicited advertising.</strong> You may not use SiSSYFiGHT to transmit any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, or any other form of solicitation.

<p><strong>12. Unauthorized access.</strong> You may not access the SiSSYFiGHT web servers, game servers or other servers involved in hosting and allowing access to the game in any way that could damage or disrupt their operation.

<p><strong>13. Illegal activities.</strong> You may not use SiSSYFiGHT to promote or conduct any kind of illegal activities, including the transmission of harmful software, malware, viruses, trojan horses, etc.

<p><strong>14. Sexual Misconduct.</strong> No explicit sexual talk is allowed in the game. Adult players of SiSSYFiGHT may not make sexual advances of any kind towards minors. Such advances may be illegal and anyone suggesting such activity will be banned. As operators of this website we take our legal obligations seriously and will forward information about any illegal sexual advances to the appropriate authorities.

<p><strong>15. Penalties.</strong> If you break any of these rules, you may incur one or more of the following penalties at the discretion of the SiSSYFiGHT adminstrators: loss of brownie and queen points, temporary suspension of SiSSYFiGHT account, permanent deletion of SiSSYFiGHT account, permanent ban from playing SiSSYFiGHT. In some cases we may also contact your Internet Service Provider if we feel you may have violated their standards or terms of service.

<p><strong>16. Your Words.</strong>  All the words, images, and sounds that make up the content of SiSSYFiGHT are open source. Anything you choose to communicate via SiSSYFiGHT, like the contents of your chat messages, becomes open source in the same way.

<p><strong>17. Changes.</strong> The Honor Code may be updated in the future. If it is, an announcement will be posted on the SiSSYFiGHT homepage. It's your responsibility to keep up to date on the Honor Code and know all the rules.<br></div>
